# üöÉ Flatland 3 Environment

Flatland tackles a key problem in the transportation world: **How to efficiently manage dense traffic on complex railway networks?**

Flatland is a simulated game environment aiming to test multi-agent reinforcment learning solutions for scheduling trains. Flatland procedurally generates maps with train tracks and cities for any given grid size. It populates these maps with trains to be taken from a source city to a destination within a time constraint. The challenge is to deal with stochasticity of malfunctions while efficiently scheduling the all trains.

Check the [Flatland Documentation](https://flatland.aicrowd.com/intro.html) to find out more.

## üï∞ What's new in Flatland 3?

Up until this point, the trains in Flatland were allowed to depart and arrive whenever they desired, the only goal was to make every train reach its destination as fast as possible. However, things are quite different in the real world. Timing and punctuality are crucial to railways. Trains have specific schedules. They are expected to depart and arrive at particular times.

This concept has been introduced to the environment in Flatland 3.0. Trains now have a time window within which they are expected to start and reach their destination.

Timetable attributes can now be accessed with `agent.earliest_departure` and `agent.latest_arrival` for every agent in a Flatland environment instance.

For people who have worked on Flatland previously, check the [migration guide](https://gitlab.aicrowd.com/flatland/flatland-starter-kit/-/blob/master/docs/flatland-3-migration-guide.md) for other code changes in Flatland 3.


# ‚öîÔ∏è Competition procedure

In this challenge, you will pit your ideas on reinforcement learning and operations research to get the best solution to Flatland 3. Your contribution may shape the way modern traffic management systems are implemented, not only in railway but also in other areas of transportation and logistics!


**The following is a high level description of how this process works.**

![](https://i.imgur.com/xzQkwKV.jpg)

1. **Sign up** to join the competition on the [Flatland 3 challenge page at AIcrowd](https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/flatland-3).
2. **Clone** this repo and start developing your solution.
3. **Design and build** your agents that can solve Flatland 3 maps.
4. [**Submit**](#-submission) your agents to [AIcrowd Gitlab](https://gitlab.aicrowd.com) for evaluation. [[Refer this for detailed instructions]](#-submission).

# üí™ Getting started

> We recommend using `python 3.6`. If you are using Miniconda/Anaconda, you can install it using `conda install python=3.6`.

Clone the starter kit repository and install the dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://gitlab.aicrowd.com/flatland/flatland-starter-kit
cd flatland-starter-kit

pip install git+http://gitlab.aicrowd.com/flatland/flatland.git

conda env create -f environment.yml
```

# üõ† Preparing your submission

## Write your agents

Implement an agent that is capable of adding producing actions for every train in the Flatland map. Refer to `baselines/run.py` for a reference agent.

**Note:** Please note that the maps are generated on the evaluator and your cannot control the settings for map generation.

# üìö Submission

## Repository Structure

**File/Directory** | **Description**
--- | ---
[`baselines`](baselines) | Directory containing an example RL agent as well as training code for the same. Please refer to `baselines/README.md` for further details.
[`utils/submit.sh`](utils/submit.sh) | Helper script to submit your repository to [AIcrowd GitLab](https://gitlab.aicrowd.com).
[`Dockerfile`](Dockerfile) | (Optional) You can add a Dockerfile for specifying your exact environment. Refer to `docs/RUNTIME.md` for further details.
[`environment.yml`](environment.yml) | File containing the list of python packages you want to install for the submission to run. This will instantiate a conda environment.
[`apt.txt`](apt.txt) | File containing the list of packages you want to install for submission to run. Refer [runtime configuration](#runtime-configuration) for more information.
[`run.sh`](evaluator) | **Submission entrypoint** - Use this as the entrypoint to run your code you need to run for your submission.
[`aicrowd.json`](aicrowd.json) | For specifying your submission track, RL or Overall.


## Runtime configuration

You can specify the list of python packages needed for your code to run in your [`environment.yml`](requirements.txt) file. We will install the packages using `conda env create -f environment.yml` command.

You can also specify the OS packages needed using [`apt.txt`](apt.txt) file. We install these packages using `apt-get install` command.

For more information on how you can configure the evaluation runtime, please refer [`RUNTIME.md`](docs/RUNTIME.md).

## üöÄ Submitting to AIcrowd

### **Add your SSH key** to AIcrowd GitLab

You can add your SSH Keys to your GitLab account by going to your profile settings [here](https://gitlab.aicrowd.com/profile/keys). If you do not have SSH Keys, you will first need to [generate one](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ssh/README.html#generating-a-new-ssh-key-pair).


### `aicrowd.json`

Your repository should have an `aicrowd.json` file with following fields:

```json
{
    "challenge_id" : "flatland-3",
    "grader_id" : "flatland-3",
    "authors" : ["Your Name"],
    "description" : "Brief description for your submission",
    "debug": false,
    "tags": "RL" OR "Overall"
}
```

This file is used to identify your submission as a part of the Flatland 3 challenge. You must use the `challenge_id`, and `grader_id` as specified above.

`debug`: If you set `debug` to `true`, then the evaluation will run for a shorter time, and the logs from your submitted code will be made available to you to help you debug. These test submissions will appear at the bottom of the leaderboard (score of -1.0).

### Configuring the submission repository

```bash
git remote add aicrowd git@gitlab.aicrowd.com:<username>/flatland-starter-kit.git
```

**Note:** This needs to be done only once. This configuration will be saved in your repository for future use.

### Pushing the code to AIcrowd

```bash
./utils/submit.sh "some description"
```

If you want to submit without the helper script, please refer [`SUBMISSION.md`](docs/SUBMISSION.md).


# üìù Submission checklist

- [x] **Accept the challenge rules**. You can do this by going to the [challenge overview page](https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/flatland-3) and clicking the "Participate" button. You only need to do this once.
- [x] **Modify run.sh** that is runs your agent's code.
- [x] **Add your model checkpoints** (if any) to the repo. The `utils/submit.sh` will automatically detect large files and add them to git LFS. If you are using the script, please refer to [this post explaining how to add your models](https://discourse.aicrowd.com/t/how-to-upload-large-files-size-to-your-submission/2304).
- [x] **Update runtime configuration** using `environment.yml`, `apt.txt` and/or `Dockerfile` as necessary. Please make sure that you specified the same package versions that you use locally on your machine.
